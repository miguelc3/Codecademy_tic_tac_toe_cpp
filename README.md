# Codecademy_tic_tac_toe_cpp

In this project I'm using c++ to program a simple game of tic tac toe between two players.
One at a time, each player chooses the field they want to play on and, when there is a winner, the program will show it!
Between rounds, the status of the game is also displayed on the terminal.
